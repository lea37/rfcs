# Summary

In the documentation, under Adding website fonctionnality > Routing > Centralizing your site's navigation part
You don't explain that we need first to import `StaticQuery` from gatsby before using it.

# Motivation

I've done your tutorial and it is the best but still, i've spent 1 hour trying to understand why my menu links were not defined
when i had them in my conf file.
I was lucky enough to check egghead videos when i was in the styled component part of gatsby doc, 
and i saw that i've been missing the import. 
I know it's kind of nothing maybe, but for people who start, it's really important i guess.

So i hope you'll update the doc ;) 

Thanks again for everything
